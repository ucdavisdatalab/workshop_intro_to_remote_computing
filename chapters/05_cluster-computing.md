What is `SLURM`?
----------------

Terms to define: partition, node (+ head node), workload manager


Partition Info and Monitoring
-----------------------------

`sinfo`: partition and node information

`squeue`: partition and node availability


Running Jobs in Real Time (`SRUN`)
----------------------------------

`srun`

`squeue --me`

Submitting Jobs to the Queue (`SBATCH`)
---------------------------------------

`sbatch`

`scancel`


Parallel Processing
-------------------

### Multi-thread jobs


### Multi-partition jobs
